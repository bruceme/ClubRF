# Instructions

3D print three STL files from this folder: **Body**, **Lid** and **Face**. You may pick some printing advisories on [my Thingiverse page](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3041339).<br>
Files that have **-V08** suffix are best suited for most recent **V08** (20190423) and **V10** (20190612) revisions of the TTGO T-Beam board.

If you are unable to print the parts by yourself - you may consider to find an appropriate local 3D service provider and place an order with assistance of [Treatstock](http://www.treatstock.com) or [3DHubs](http://www.3dhubs.com/) portals.

At first, insert printed face panel into front rails. Place T-Beam board into the enclosure's main body. Put lid on top of the assembly. Fasten the lid with four 2.5x10 mm screws.

# GoPro mount option

Two variants of main body are available. One is with GoPro mount and another one is without it.

# OLED display option

You may opt for 0.96" front I2C OLED display panel.<br>
Be aware that average 0.96" OLED does not perform well against sun light.<br>
Two variants of the panel are available: 
- the first design is for generic 0.96" OLED ;
- the other one is for [TTGO version](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32922106384.html) of the display.
